Frames are `gp_Ax3(origin, z, x)`: `x` is projected perpendicular to `z`
and both are normalised, `y = z × x`. A pair is two surfaces, a curve
`a` against a surface `b`, or two curves with a `nurbs` one among them
or two conics. An `elliptic_cylinder` is the section ellipse extruded
along `z` (`Geom_SurfaceOfLinearExtrusion`), Open CASCADE having no
analytic surface for it, which is the same point set; it is not a `gp`
quadric, so it takes no surface pair, and it is trimmed to
`EXTRUSION_REACH` either way along its axis, since the general
intersector finds nothing on an unbounded parametric range. Every number
may be an expression over `params` as in the solid kind.

The result per sample: `Geom_*::D2` at every parameter and
`GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` / `OnCurve` for every point (nearest point,
its parameters, the distance). Per pair: `IntAna_QuadQuadGeo` for two
surfaces — the type (`empty`, `coincident`, `point`, `line`, `circle`,
`ellipse`, `parabola`, `hyperbola` — one branch per curve — or `unsolved`
where it finds no conic,
`IntAna_NoGeometricSolution`) and, for every curve it returns, its type
and sampled points, or for a `point` result its points; an `unsolved`
pair also carries the lines `GeomAPI_IntSS` walks, as curves of type
`section`, each sampled and every sample polished onto both surfaces by
Newton steps; a line along which the surfaces are tangent at a sample
has no crossing to polish onto, and the walk of a touch is no ground
truth (1e-4 off the touching circle of a sphere in a cylinder), so it is
dropped and counted under `dropped` — or
`IntAna_IntConicQuad` for a conic against a plane or a quadric, or
`IntAna_IntLinTorus` for a line against a torus: `coincident`, or
`points` with every hit's point and conic parameter, duplicates within
`Precision::Confusion` reported once (a tangent touch comes back twice).
A conic against a torus or an elliptic cylinder has no `IntAna` form and
goes through `GeomAPI_IntCS` below, which has no `coincident`: it reports
a conic lying on one of those two as a cloud of hundreds of points, so a
fixture asks it only where the two cross or touch.

A `nurbs` surface is a `Geom_BSplineSurface` of the recipe's degrees and
knots (flat, as a curve's: each written as often as it repeats),
control net (a row per control point of `u`) and weights, so both
parameters are the recipe's. It is evaluated at parameters and points are
projected onto it, by `GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf`, whose lowest distance
is the nearest point; it is not paired.

A `nurbs` curve is a `Geom_BSplineCurve` of the recipe's degree, knots
(flat: each written as often as it repeats), Cartesian control points and
weights, so its parameter is the recipe's. Against a surface it goes
through `GeomAPI_IntCS`, the general curve–surface intersector: `points`
with every hit's point and curve parameter, held to both operands and
deduplicated as the conics' are. It has no `coincident`: a segment of the
curve on the surface is an error here, since no fixture means one.

A pair may also be two curves — one of them a `nurbs` one, or two conics:
Open CASCADE has
no 3D curve–curve intersector, so its `GeomAPI_ExtremaCurveCurve` over
the two curves' domains — a line's over `LINE_REACH` either side of its
origin, a B-spline's span by span, since over the whole domain the search
misses crossings — stands in, every extremum within `Precision::Confusion` a hit:
`points` with each hit's point (the first curve's), its parameter `t` on
the first curve and `tb` on the second, deduplicated as above. It has no
`coincident`: extrema say nothing of two curves that are one, and no
fixture means one.

//! Strategies for random sketches: a star polygon with arcs and holes in
//! a random plane pose, in either orientation; a rectilinear staircase
//! beside an axis or reaching it, with the sweep parameters that go with
//! it; and a general profile beside an axis or with a side along it, whose
//! segments sweep every surface kind.
//!
//! Every profile a strategy here produces is a *valid* one —
//! `Profile::edges` accepts it — so a property over sweeps never has to
//! discard a case. That is bought with the shape of the generator rather
//! than with a filter: the outer loop's vertices sit at strictly
//! increasing angles about a centre, which makes the polygon star-shaped
//! and so simple, and an arc replaces a chord by a shallow bulge *outward*
//! whose sagitta stays a small fraction of the chord, which keeps it
//! inside the angular sector the chord spans and keeps the region
//! star-shaped. The holes are placed inside the largest disc about the
//! centre that the chords leave free. [`general`] needs deeper arcs, so
//! its polygon is convex (see there).

/// the extrude length is random.
///
/// The polygon is convex, unlike [`star`]'s, because the torus arcs are
/// deep: two outward arcs meeting at a notch would cross. On a convex
/// polygon an outward arc of at most a semicircle lies in the half-disc
/// on its chord, which lies in the chord's sector from the centre while
/// the chord subtends less than a right angle, so arcs on different
/// chords never meet away from their shared vertex, and the half-discs
/// on adjacent chords meet only there (their circles' other common point
/// is the foot of the vertex on the third side). A sphere arc is shallow
/// — its radius is at least the profile's distance from the axis — and
/// bulges away from the axis, inward on the axis side of the polygon,
/// where the holes' disc is shrunk by its sagitta. With a side along the
/// axis a pole's arc leaves the axis square to it, into the polygon, and
/// turns by less than the convex corner at its other end leaves room for,
/// which is why no other chord may bulge inward too.

//! An analytic surface as the zero set of a polynomial in its own frame,
//! and whatever is put into it as a polynomial in Bernstein form: a
//! rational curve span (`crate::intersect_spline`) or a rational surface
//! patch (`crate::trace_torus`).
//!
//! Every analytic surface is the zero set of a polynomial `F` of degree
//! `d` — one for a plane, two for a quadric, four for a torus. Rational
//! coordinates `(x, y, z) / w` put into it and cleared of their
//! denominator, `g = wᵈ F((x, y, z) / w)`, are a polynomial with the sign
//! of `F` wherever `w` is positive, built from the homogeneous
//! coordinates by products in the Bernstein basis and never through
//! power coefficients. [`Implicit::along`] is that substitution, over
//! whichever Bernstein arithmetic the coordinates live in
//! ([`BernsteinAlgebra`]): one variable for a curve, two for a patch.
//!
//! What is decided on `g` is only *where to look*. `g` carries a factor
//! the size of the surface's dimensions to the power `d`, so what is
//! there is decided in length, on the exact signed [`Implicit::distance`]
//! and its [`Implicit::gradient`]; [`Implicit::steepness`] is what ties
//! the two scales together where a tolerance in length has to be stated
//! on `g`.

//! The builder and the Euler operators (`docs/DATA-MODEL.md` §Euler
//! operators, ADR-0002): the only way an operation makes topology.
//!
//! Entities in the arena are immutable and Euler operators mutate, so the
//! two meet in a [`Builder`]: a staging area holding one body under
//! construction, edited by Mäntylä's ten operators (*An Introduction to
//! Solid Modeling*, ch. 9, adapted to coedges and seams), and frozen into
//! the arena by [`Builder::finish`], which appends every entity in a
//! deterministic order inside a transaction.
//!
//! What the builder guarantees: every operator keeps the Euler–Poincaré
//! line at zero ([`Builder::counts`]); every operator has an inverse that
//! restores the builder byte for byte ([`Builder::dump`]) — a killed slot
//! is reused by the next make, loops are kept in a canonical rotation and
//! order, so the state after `op` then `op⁻¹` is the state before; and
//! `finish` refuses a body that is not closed as the kind asked for, a
//! loop without coedges, a coedge without a pcurve, or a geometry id that
//! does not resolve — each a typed [`BuildError`] — and then the model is
//! exactly as it was.
//!
//! What it does not do: it never computes a pcurve and never evaluates
//! geometry. Every pcurve is the caller's ([`Strut::pcurves`],
//! [`Split::pcurves`], [`Builder::set_pcurve`]), since only the caller
//! knows which use of a seam it is drawing; and the checker
//! (`arris-check`, above this crate) is where the finished body is
//! proven.
//!
//! Orientations inside the builder are *effective*: a [`Use`] is walked
//! as seen from outside the material with the face's outward normal up,
//! whatever the surface's own normal, and each [`StagedFace`] carries the
//! orientation the shell will use it with. `finish` stores a loop of a
//! `Reversed` face backwards with every use flipped, which is what
//! `docs/DATA-MODEL.md` §Orientation says a stored loop is.
